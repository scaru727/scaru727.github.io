    <h1>The Bowery Hotel</h1>


    <h2>The Most Haunted Hotels in New York</h2>
    




    <p>
 The Bowery Hotel's excellent East Village location gives its celebrity guests and fashionable clientele easy access to some of the city's hippest restaurants, bars, and boutiques. But the neighborhood isn't just prime for the fashion set - it's also the final resting place for more than 2,000 souls in Marble Cemetery, which lies just a block from the luxurious gritty-chic hotel. Perhaps one of these spirits is responsible for the supposedly nightly occurrence of elevators going wild at 1 a.m. Rumor has it,others have also had conversations with guests who simply disappear mid-sentence.

     "At The Bowery Hotel, staff welcome you... and also its resident ghosts!"

 Haunted lifts that like to stop randomly in the middle of the night are the least of employeesâ€™ concerns. Many other strange and creepy things happen frequently at The Bowery Hotel. One guest, for instance, was welcomed by a female spirit dressed in white when he checked into his room. Another had his beer glass spilled all over him, though he was sitting by himself.
