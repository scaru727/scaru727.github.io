Mr. Versace found his inspiration from  what was happening on the street, in modern art, in film. Force-feeding even the most recalcitrant client his eclectic knowledge of the real world. The distinctiveness of his powerful prints, their roots in the historic past became the archetype for modern fashion: a movable signature that defines the wearer as co-conspirator with a designer mind. As much as Mr. Versace invented in fashion itself, he altered the presentation of the art completely.

<div class="Q1">
How do you live, Gianni Versace?
</div>

<div class="A1">
I live as I please.
</div>

<div class="Q2">
How about your work?
</div>


<div class="A2">
My work is very important for me. If I did not feel I was leading from the front I would quit right away.
</div>


<div class="Q3">
How did your explosive success come about?
</div>


<div class="A3">
It comes from where I want to be, from what I want to accomplish. I understand people and I have a good business sense. And then we work together as a family: my sister and my brother are both very good indeed.
</div>

<div class="Q4">
When do you think about work?
</div>


<div class="A4">
By now it is part of my life-cycle. I cannot distinguish myself from my work. It is always there, as necessary to me as drinking water. It is something completely natural. I have never forced myself to try to do anything in my entire life. For example, I wake up, I sit down at a table and I wait to see what idea comes to me. I never see my clients, unless I would enjoy doing so. I always sell a high quality product and I eat alone or with whoever I want to.
