<div class="paragraph">
 The late Gianni Versace birthed a cultural legacy that is now carried on by his sister and current head designer at Versace, Donatella. <br>
 
Suddenly without Gianni, the House of Versace found itself in the midst of worldwide media attention and grief, leading to a sharp decline in the brand. For a time, the glory of Versace seemed to be shrouded in despair. However, succeeding her older brother as head designer, Donatella Versace soon revitalized the brand. Breathing new life into the style empire, she established a new direction for Versace for a new century. </div>
